# SCT_ML_01
ðŸ“ˆ Crop Production Prediction using Linear Regression
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict agricultural crop production based on historical features such as area, season, crop type, and year. The model uses real-world dataset preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, and regression techniques to estimate the target variable: production quantity.

ðŸ§° Features
âœ… Handles missing or invalid values (e.g., non-numeric entries in Production)

âœ… Encodes categorical columns using Label Encoding

âœ… Scales features using StandardScaler

âœ… Splits data into training and test sets for evaluation

âœ… Implements Linear Regression from scikit-learn

âœ… Evaluates model using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Columns Used
Feature-----Description
Area-----Total sown area for the crop
Season-----Season in which crop is grown
Crop-----Name of the crop
Crop_Year-----Year of cultivation
Production-----Target variable (crop yield)
